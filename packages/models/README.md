# mittwald API models

This package contains a collection of domain models for coherent interaction
with the mittwald API.

## Installing

You can install this package from the regular NPM registry:

```shell
yarn add @mittwald/api-models
```

## Examples

```typescript
// Get a detailed project
const detailedProject = await Project.get("p-vka9t3");

// Create a project reference
const projectRef = Project.ofId("p-vka9t3");

// Get the detailed project from the proxy
const anotherDetailedProject = await projectRef.getDetailed();

// Update project description
await detailedProject.updateDescription("My new description!");

// This method just needs the ID and a description and
// thus is also available on the proxy!
await projectRef.updateDescription("My new description!");

// Accessing the projects server (proxy)
const server = project.server;

// List all projects of this server
const serversProjects = await server.listProjects();

// List all projects
const allProjects = await Project.list();

// Iterate over project List Models
for (const project of serversProjects) {
  await project.leave();
}
```

## Usage in React

This package also provides methods aligned to be used in React components. It
uses
[@mittwald/react-use-promise](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mittwald/react-use-promise)
to encapsulate all asynchronous functions into AsyncResources. More details
about how to use AsyncResources see the package documentation.

### Installation

To use the React client you have to install the additional
@mittwald/react-use-promise package:

```shell
yarn add @mittwald/react-use-promise
```

All asynchronous methods provide a `use`-method property. This method uses
[@mittwald/react-use-promise](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mittwald/react-use-promise)
under the hood to "resolve" the promise in the "React way".

```typescript
const detailedProject = Project.get.use("p-vka9t3");

// Create a project reference
const projectRef = Project.ofId("p-vka9t3");

// Get the detailed project from the proxy
const anotherDetailedProject = projectRef.getDetailed.use();

// Accessing the projects server (proxy)
const server = project.server;

// List all projects of this server
const serversProjects = server.listProjects.use();

// List all projects
const allProjects = Project.list.use();
```

## Immutability and state updates

Most of all models provided by this package represent an associated counter-part
in the backend. When a model is loaded from the backend, the current state is
incorporated into the model instance. To keep it simple and predictable this
**state is immutable and does not change under any circumstances**. As a result
you must create a new instance to get an updated model and propagate it
throughout the runtime code.

This also applies for operations initiated at client-side. For example when the
`updateDescription` method is called on a project, the project instance will
still have the old description.

"Watching for changes" is not scope of this package and will be implemented in
future releases or other packages‚Ñ¢Ô∏è.

## Contribute

**As a general advice when contributing, be sure to look at the existing source
code and use it as a template!**

Please consider the following conventions when adding or modifying models.

### File structure

Structure the models in meaningful directories.

### Use the base classes

Models should extend (or inherit) the correct base class. You can find the base
classes in `src/base`. The following classes are available.

#### `DataModel`

The DataModel is the foundation of all model classes that contain a set of
immutable generic data.

#### `ProxyModel`

A ProxyModel represents a certain model just by its ID. As the most basic model
operations often just need the ID and some input data (deleting, renaming, ...),
Proxy Models can avoid unnecessary API round trips.

### Stick to the ubiquitous language

When adding models or methods pay close attention to the (maybe existing)
language used in the respective domain. Talk to the responsible team if you are
uncertain.

### Models as abstraction layer

Models should cover the following aspects:

- Coherent representation of the business logic
- Simple loading of models and there linked entities
- Methods to interact with the model in an intuitive way
- Preprocessing of the models raw data to increase DX
- Consistent API

### Type of models

#### Detailed vs. List Models

The response type for some models often differs when loading single items or
lists. To reduce the amount of data, the list response type is usually a subset
of the comprehensive model. Add separate classes for the Detailed Model (name it
`[Model]Detailed`) and the List Model (name it `[Model]ListItem`).

If both model share a common code base, you should add a Common Model (name it
`[Model]Common`).

#### Proxy Models

A Proxy Model represents a certain model just by its ID. As the most basic model
operations often just need the ID and some input data (deleting, renaming, ...),
Proxy Models can avoid unnecessary API round trips. These classes should be used
as a return type for new created models or for linked models.

To get the actual Detailed Model, Proxy Models must have a
`function getDetailed(): Promise<ModelDetailed>` method.

Consider extending the Proxy Model when implementing the Entry-Point Model.

#### Implementation details

When implementing shared functionality, like in the Common Models, you can use
the [`polytype`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/polytype) library to realize
dynamic multiple inheritance. Be sure to look at the existing source code for
implementation examples.

#### Entry-Point Model

Provide a single model (name it `[Model]`) as an entry point for all different
model types (detailed, list, proxy, ...). As a convention provide a default
export for this model.

### Use the correct verbs

#### `find`

Models should have a static `find` method. The find method returns the detailed
model or may return `undefined` if the model can not be found.

#### `get`

In addition to the `find` method models should have a static `get` method. The
get method should return the desired object or throw an `ObjectNotFoundError`.
You can use the `find` method and assert the existence with the
`assertObjectFound` function.

#### `list`

When a list of objects should be loaded use a `list` method. It may support a
`query` parameter to filter the result by given criteria.

#### `create`

When a model should be created use a static `create` method. This method should
return a proxy of the created resource.

### Accessing "linked" models

Most of the models are part of a larger model tree. Models should provide
methods to get the parent and child models, like `project.getServer()`,
`server.listProjects()` or `server.getCustomer()`. Use `get`, `list` or `find`
prefixes as described above.

#### Use Proxy Models resp. Entry-Point Models when possible!

When a linked model provides a Proxy Model or Entry-point Model, create it in
the model constructor, to avoid unnecessary API round trips.

### Abstraction of model behaviors

Models are usually backed by a set of behaviors, defining the basic model
interactions. In order to actually "use" the model, it must be initialized with
a concrete behavior implementation. This layer of abstraction removes
implementation specific code from the model, and also makes behaviors
exchangeable without any impact on the model itself - for example inside unit
tests.

Consider using behaviors for:

- API interactions
- Storing and loading local data
- Complex computations or logic (maybe supported by an external library)

#### Encapsulate API interaction inside behaviors

Encapsulate any API interaction inside the model behaviors to prevent strong
coupling of model and API-specific implementation.

##### Don't ü•¥

```typescript
class ProjectDetailed {
  public static async find(
    id: string,
  ): Promise<ProjProjectDetailed | undefined> {
    const response = await client.project.getProject({
      id,
    });

    if (response.status === 200) {
      return new Project(response.data.id, response.data);
    }
    assertStatus(response, 403);
  }
}
```

##### Do üòÉ

```typescript
class ProjectDetailed {
  public static async find(id: string): Promise<ProjectDetailed | undefined> {
    const data = await Project.behaviors.find(id);
    if (data !== undefined) {
      return new Project(data.id, data);
    }
  }
}
```
